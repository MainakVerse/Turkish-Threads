        "description": "Turkish rags owe their world-renowned quality to the unique characteristics of Turkish cotton. This cotton variety boasts extra-long fibers, a key factor that sets it apart from other types of cotton. These longer fibers result in fewer joins in the weave of the fabric, creating a smoother, softer, and more durable end product. The long fibers also contribute to the exceptional absorbency of Turkish rags. The fabric's structure allows it to soak up moisture efficiently, making it ideal for various cleaning tasks. Additionally, Turkish cotton is known for its quick-drying properties, preventing the rags from becoming damp and potentially harboring mildew or bacteria. Another noteworthy aspect of Turkish rags is their low-lint nature. The long fibers minimize shedding, ensuring that the rags leave behind minimal residue during use.",
